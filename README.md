# Julia Tips

## Adding Julia to the PATH

[Getting Started with Julia](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introducing_Julia/Getting_started#Getting_started) is a good resource to figuring out how to add Julia to your PATH.

Linux,
```
sudo ln -fs path/to/the/binaries/for/julia/bin/julia /usr/local/bin/julia
```

Mac,
```
ln -fs "/Applications/Julia-1.3.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia" /usr/local/bin/julia
```

For Windows (see [How to Add Julia Program to System's Path in Windows 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDvviyjdJFU)).

## The Package Manager

- Project
  - Package
  - Application
- Project Structure
  - *Project.toml*
  - *Manifest.toml*
  - `src/ModuleName.jl`
  - `test/runtests.jl`
  - `docs/make.jl`
- Environments
  - Shared
  - Best Practices
- Registry ([General](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General))
- `DEPOT_PATH`


## The Pkg CLI

- `status` (`st`)
- `activate`
- `add`
- `develop`
- `rm`
- `update` (`up`)
- `instantiate`
- `precompile`

## Environmental Variables
- `JULIA_NUM_THREADS`

## Miscellaneous
- Docstrings
- Modules

## Git Ignore
`~/.gitignore_global`

# System-specific files and directories generated by the BinaryProvider and BinDeps packages
# They contain absolute paths specific to the host computer, and so should not be committed

# Build artifacts for creating documentation generated by the Documenter package

# File generated by Pkg, the package manager, based on a corresponding Project.toml
# It records a fixed state of all packages used by the project. As such, it should not be
# committed for packages, but should be committed for applications that require a static
# environment.
Manifest.toml
```
